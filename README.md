> The Healthy Fast Food Project! ðŸŒ¯ðŸ¥—

### This is Javier's and Keene's Assignment Two for Interactive Development.

#### This is a website of a fast food company but with a twist of Healthy Food.

## Design Process:

- [x] Animation Page either using CSS or Lottie that redirects to Main Page
- [x] Second Page: Main Page
- [x] Third Page: Menu
- [x] Fourth Page: Available Locations/Map
- [ ] Fifth Page: Log in/Sign Up Page using RestDB
- [x] Sixth Page: Shopping Cart
- [x] Side Navigation Bars with different options

## The Website:

With a simple yet concise lay-out to showcase our store so that it is easy and intuitive for users to find and access the services that they are looking for with buttons and the Navbar. Green, white & grey were used as the colours are often associated with grocery stores.

## User Story:

> As a user of the website, I want to be able to navigate my way easily and find the food item I would want to purchase without any hassles.

## Technology Used:

- HTML

  > The project uses HTML for the HTML document of the website.

- CSS

  > The project uses CSS for styling of the website.

- JavaScript & JQuery

  > The project uses both JavaScript and JQuery to add functionality to the website.

- RestDB
  > The project uses restdb.io to store details regarding aspects such as user accounts.
